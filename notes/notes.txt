Day 1 of jam. Theme is "Evolving Abilities". I'm thinking of doing something
related to an incremental game. Ideally the mechanics itself is all about
evolving abilities. The idea is that your child has been kidnapped by a
dragon, so you are going to mine down the mountain to rescue them. It starts
off with you clicking on the mountain to mine it, and then clicking on the
mined material, to move it to base. And in base, it gets ecaluated some value.
Then you can get dwarves who will mine for you, and some other creatures who
will carry the material for you. then you unlock bigger miners, andtrains to
move the material quickly and things along those lines. I feel it hits the
evolving well enough, but maybe could be better. Overall I like the idea of
the incremental style game

I'm still not fully sure exactly how the presentation is going to be, but for
now, lets just stick with the bring down the mountain kinda thing. Or maybe we
can do a bring down the dam kinda thing? Either way, lets start off and get
the basics in place and see how it goes. Lets start off with a color pallete.

NEXT: Implement Carriers
